## Machine Learning Course Project Report

(tried the "auto mirroring trick" for gh-pages found at
http://brettterpstra.com/2012/09/26/github-tip-easily-sync-your-master-to-github-pages/)

I accidentally submitted the URL of the GitHub repo instead of the gh-pages one.   
Please accept my apologies.

Please see the more convenient gh-pages version at http://pedrosan.github.io/ML/   
It is also posted at http://rpubs.com/PedroSan/ML-WL   
The stand-alone html file produced for posting on RPubs is also included in this repo as "rpubs.html"
